# SSD Course Website Transformation

## Overview
This project transforms the original single-page SSD course website into a visually appealing, modern web page using CSS and JavaScript. The transformed page is named `newssd.html` and is designed to retain all original information while improving usability and aesthetics.

## Features
- Modern responsive layout using CSS
- Enhanced typography and color scheme
- Interactive elements powered by JavaScript
- All original content preserved
- Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access

## How to View
Visit the transformed website at:
```
https://parv-the-coder.github.io/cs6302_ssd_new_monsoon2025/newssd.html
```

## Assumptions
- The original page contains all required SSD course information and no content is removed during transformation.
- No backend or server-side logic is required; all enhancements are client-side (CSS/JS only).
- The page is intended for desktop and mobile users, so responsive design is applied.
- Hosting is done via GitHub Pages, so only static files (HTML, CSS, JS) are used.

## Interpretation
- The transformation does not alter the structure or meaning of the content, only its presentation.
- Interactive features (e.g., collapsible sections, smooth scrolling) are added for better navigation and user experience.

## How It Works
- `newssd.html` is the main entry point.
- `style.css` provides the modern look and feel.
- `script.js` adds interactivity (e.g., menu toggles, dynamic highlights).
- All files are static and can be hosted directly on GitHub Pages.
